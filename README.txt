The idea of this project is to study the role of magnon magnon interaction in the spectral function of an altermagnet.
Renormalization and broadening might appear as a consequence of interacting many-body processes. 
These efects could not be captured by using linear Holstein Primakoff transformation or LLG simulations.
As a quasi-exact technique we use DMRG and TDVP for time evolving algorithms.
Altermagnets rotation symmetry makes the system be at least quasi 1D in order to be really an altermagnet.
Furthermore, we plan to study the effects of the inclusion of an external magnetic field, as well as DMI.

Progress (40%)
I've computed the spectral function of an anisotropic altermagnet using the J1-J2-\delta model. 
The role of the \delta parameter is to act as a breathing direction dependent next-nearest neighbor interaction.
